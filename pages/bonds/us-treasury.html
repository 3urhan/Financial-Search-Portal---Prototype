        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            U.S. Treasury bonds are debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on behalf of the federal government. 
            They are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treasury bonds have maturities of more than 10 years and pay interest semi-annually. They are widely used as a benchmark 
            for other interest rates and are a key component of many investment portfolios.
